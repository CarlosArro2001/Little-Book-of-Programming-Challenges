# Little-Book-of-Programming-Challenges

### What is this? 

##### The files are programs which are directly from the booklet "The Little Book of Programming Challenges" , these are all coded in C but students can use these as a reference to how they should code the program in other languages. 

### Noteable errors and issues 
##### Considering the fact that this is written in C some might programs might be hard to understand especially for beginners , as well as that there has been crashes and hidden errors specifically with the pointers. 
##### The days.c file is not the correct program as to put it simply I do not know how to do it.

### Note
#### The PDF for the booklet is uploaded here also incase you don't have a hard/soft copy of it.
